Game Overview *****************************************************

The game is called Abandoned. A maximum of three players are on another planet in what is left of an outer space colony. This colony has been damaged and evacuated. Players wake up and discover that in the confusion of the evacuation they have been left behind. Players need to call the ship and survive long enough to get picked up. Players will face enemies, and dodge debris as they try to get to their designated pick-up spot. The game is won when all players get to the pick-up point. 

The game is a multiplayer 2-Dimensional platformer survival game. It will have a side view of the map, like most 2-D platformers. Players will jump, climb and run through the map, dodging debris. There will be enemies to deal with along the way. They can either be avoided or attacked. Players will work together to call the ship and get to the pick-up point. They will spend the first half of the game looking for a radio, and the second half getting to the pick-up point. There will be tools the players can use to attack enemies, and/or destroy debris. These tools will work as powerups to aid the players in their objective. 

We’ll start off with a black background and an overlaying tile map. Players will see a map of a colony section, with piles of debris where some of the structure has broken. It will be an enclosed space with walls and floors. They will also see strange creatures and dropped tools. Players will be able to climb over debris piles, as well as jump and climb on walls. The players can attack creatures and destroy debris in their way. 

We thought it would be interesting to create a game that can be done collaboratively.  

 

Development Strategy *********************************************

We will start from scratch and see if we can copy some code from project 1 as we go along. We will aim to have the first goal done by November 10th or soon after.  We’ll work on the next goal for a week or two. We’ll aim to have the third goal done by December 1st. 

Goal 1: Game Base 

Sharon will work on the maps and start on the camera. 

Aurora will work on getting the camera to move with the player. 

Aurora will start working on collisions. 

The person who finishes their other tasks first will work on jumping, climbing and gravity. 

Goal 2: Networking 

The team will come up with an outline of the networking structure. 

They will assign tasks to each teammate. 

Goal 3: Power ups and Enemies 

Aurora will do one of the power ups/tools and Sharon will do the other one. 

Whoever finishes their tool first will outline the enemies and start pathfinding.
